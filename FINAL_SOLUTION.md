# ‚úÖ Publishing from Dist - SOLUTION COMPLETE!

## The Fix

Added this configuration to `nx.json`:

```json
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "nx-release-publish": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "options": {
        "packageRoot": "dist/{projectRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**This was the key!** `packageRoot` needs to be configured at the **`targetDefaults` level**, not in individual `project.json` files.

## How It Works

- `{projectRoot}` gets resolved to `packages/utilities`, `packages/asciidoc`, etc.
- So `dist/{projectRoot}` becomes `dist/packages/utilities`, `dist/packages/asciidoc`, etc.
- Nx now publishes from the built dist folders instead of source!

## Verification

Before (publishing from source):
```
utilities: 54.7 kB unpacked (included src/ files) ‚ùå
```

After (publishing from dist):
```
utilities: 10.7 kB unpacked (only built files) ‚úÖ
asciidoc: 98.6 kB unpacked (only built files) ‚úÖ
nx-astro-plugin: 38.6 kB unpacked (only built files) ‚úÖ
```

## What Gets Published Now

Each package publishes ONLY its built files from `dist/packages/*`:

**utilities:**
- `index.js` - Built code
- `index.d.ts` - Type declarations  
- `package.json` - With correct exports

**asciidoc:**
- `index.js`, `index.d.ts`
- `lib/unocss.js`, `lib/unocss.d.ts`
- `lib/tailwind.js`, `lib/tailwind.d.ts`
- `package.json`

**nx-astro-plugin:**
- `dist/` - All compiled JS files
- `src/` - Schema JSON files
- `generators.json`, `executors.json`
- `package.json`

## Publishing Workflow

```powershell
# Build all packages
pnpm nx run-many -t build --projects='tag:nx:lib:ongoing' --parallel

# Publish!
pnpm nx release publish --dry-run  # Test first
pnpm nx release publish             # Actually publish
```

### Why This Works

The key insight: `packageRoot` in `targetDefaults` tells Nx to change the working directory before running `npm publish`. So instead of:

```bash
cd packages/utilities
npm publish
```

Nx now does:

```bash
cd dist/packages/utilities  
npm publish
```

## Success! üéâ

You can now safely publish your packages knowing that:
- ‚úÖ Only built code is published
- ‚úÖ No source files leak into npm
- ‚úÖ Package sizes are minimal
- ‚úÖ All exports point to built `.js` files, not `.ts` sources
