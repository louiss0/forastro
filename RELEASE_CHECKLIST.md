```

pnpm exec nx run-many --target build --projects 'tag:nx:lib:ongoing'
```
- [ ] All builds complete successfully
- [ ] Check `/dist/packages/` contents
- [ ] Verify built package.json versions match tags

#### Step 3: Publish to npm
```bash
# Dry run first
pnpm nx release publish --dry-run

# Publish to npm
pnpm nx release publish
```
- [ ] All packages publish successfully
- [ ] Verify packages appear on npmjs.com
- [ ] Check package installation: `npm info @forastro/[package-name]`
