:description: This is the Language reference guide for Asciidoc.


{description} I wrote this because It's 
easier to look at this page rather than having to look at the docs.
I won't teach you everything but the essentials will taught. 
One of the first things I'd like you to know is that Asciidoc 
is compatible with Markdown syntax. 

One thing you have noticed so far is that I didn't write any front matter.
You can but this isn't idiomatic and for the most part unnecessary. I also used the `{}`
syntax with a word that was called description This is interpolation. 
I created a custom attribute called `:description:` Then decided to interpolate it. 

An Asciidoc page always starts with title that you can interpolate by using `doctitle`.
The Second line is called the _Author line_. Which allows you to type in the Author's Full name and then an email. The *email must be surrounded by angle brackets*.
By writing the author line you get.

* The Authors full name by interpolating `author`.
* The Emaill by interpolating `email`.
* The Author's inittials by interpolating `authorinitials`.
* The first name by interpolating `firstname`.
* The last name by interpolating `lastname`.

There's more stuff but this is what most people would use anyway.

== Writing Syntax 

A paragraph in Asciidoc is just one or more sentences. Just like markdown!

Bold is written like this.  `\*Bold*`

Italic is written like this. `\_Italic_`

Underline is written like this. [.underline]#underline#

Line through is written like this. `\[.line-through]\#line through#`

Highlight is written like this.   `\#highlight#`

Super script is written like this.  `\^super^script`

Subscript is written like this. `\~sub~script`

A double quote is written like this. `\"`double quote`"``

A single quote is written like this. `\"`single quote`"``

An apostrophe is written like this.  `apostrophe`"`

A bare link is written like this `\https://asciidoctor.org`

A named link is written like this `\https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]`

A inline code is written like this \``script.ts``.

A thematic break is written like this.

`''''`

A page break is written like this 

`<<<`

A block of code is written like this.

\````sh pnpm run test````


A code block can also be written like this.

----
  [,sh]
  ----
  pnpm run dev
  ----

A hard line break is written like this.

[,adoc]
----
Roses are red, +
violets are blue.
----

Hard breaks can also be added to attributes as well.

[source,adoc] 
----
:fruits: apple +
         orange +
         kiwi 
----


A lead paragraph is written like this. 

[,adoc]
----
[.lead]
I lead with this.

=== Lists

A list is item is a sentence that is prefixed with one or more stars.
Each star is an indicator of how many levels deep a list item is.

This is how you write an unordered list.

[,adoc]
----
* Level 1 list item
** Level 2 list item
*** Level 3 list item
**** Level 4 list item
***** Level 5 list item
****** etc.
* Level 1 list item
----

This is how you write an ordered list.

[,adoc]
----
. Level 1 list item
.. Level 2 list item
... Level 3 list item
.... Level 4 list item
..... Level 5 list item
...... etc.
. Level 1 list item
----

A description list 

[,adoc]
----
First term:: The description can be placed on the same line
as the term.
Second term:: Description of the second term.
The description can also start on its own line.
----

A check list. Both the star and X mean checked.

```adoc
* [*] checked
* [x] also checked
* [ ] not checked
```

=== Sections 

A section is written by using a word prefixed with either 1-5 hashes `#` or equals `=`.

CAUTION: You can only only use one equal sign at the top level as the doc title.

[source,adoc]
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title
----


== Blocks  

A block is a container that tells Asciidoc to do something special with a series of content. They normally start with 3-4 dots equal signs or dashes under the attribute list and a the same symbols at the bottom. Some block's may require one sign.
Some blocks require an attribute list. `[,adoc]` 


.A Sidebar block
==== 
```adoc
****
    I live aside from the main content.
****
```
====

.An Example block
==== 
```adoc
  ====
      I'm clearly an example.
  ====
```

.Blockquote

[quote,Abraham Lincoln,Address delivered at the dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg]
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation...
____

----
====

.Pass though block. *A block that render's content as is*.
====
```adoc
++++
<p>
Content in a passthrough block is passed to the output unprocessed.
That means you can include raw HTML, like this embedded Gist:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux/5333524.js">
</script>
++++
```
====


[TIP]
.A block can also have a title.
====
When it has a title it must start with a *.*

=== Attributes

A block attribute list is a syntax that goes on top of blocks. It adds
special characteristics to that block that controls it's behavior.
It's written by using opposing brackets as delimiters `[attr]`.
An attribute can either be a word `source` or a word followed by an equal sign then ended with double quotes `width="25%"` or a number `cols=3`. Each list of attributes are separated by commas.


[NOTE] 
.An attribute being added to a block
====
[source,adoc]

[xml]
++++
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
</dependency>
++++

----
====


[TIP]
.Attribute lists can be suffixed or prefixed with symbols.
====
 A dot prefix `.text-red-400` is the shorthand for a class name. A hash prefix is the shorthand for an id  
====

IMPORTANT: A paragraph or a sentence is a block.

=== Admonitions 

Admonition blocks are blocks that render text that is supposed to be noted by the user.
People call them *call outs* in other markup languages. They are written by using the keywords *NOTE IMPORTANT CAUTION WARNING*. 

IMPORTANT: Yes they must be written in uppercase.

IMPORTANT: Admonitions use 4 equal signs `====` as delimiters.

[NOTE]
====
 This is a note.

=== Tables 

A table is a special block that is written by using three equal signs prefixed with a pipe `|===` at the top and the bottom. To write a row in between the delimiters you first type pipe `|` which then type words. Columns are separated by commas.
The first row is the header row followed by a space. 

[source,adoc]
----

|=== 
| Column 1, Column 2

| Cell 1, Cell 2

|===

----

Columns are specified by using the the cols attribute `cols=3`. If not specified the respected cols will be based on the ones that are in the header. The cold attribute can take an int or a string with numbers separated by commas. Each number added dictates then number of columns rendered.

== Macros

A macro is a special syntax that uses a word followed by a colon then an attribute list at the end `element:[]`.

== Referencing and Transclusion

Different sections of a document can be linked to each other.
Inter document references can be done too. When using transclusion you can select ranges lines of text or even 


.Referencing a section
====

```adoc
<<_writing_syntax>>
```
==== 

.Referencing a Section then rendering s different name
====

```adoc
<<_writing_syntax, The Writing Syntax>>
```
====

.Referring to another doc
====

```adoc
Refer to link:document-b.html#section-b[Section B] for more information.
```

====

.Transclusion
====
```adoc
  include::partial.adoc[]
```
