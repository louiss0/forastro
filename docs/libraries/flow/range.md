# Range

```tsx
<Range start={iterable} stop={} step={} >
    {(value:unknown, info: IterationInfo, key:unknown) => unknown}
</Range>
```

The for component is a for loop that relies on an iterable. It creates a for loop that passes a function that has three parameters.

- The value
- The IterationInfo
- The key.

What ever is returned from the callback is rendered as HTML.
