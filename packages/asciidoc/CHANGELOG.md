## 2.3.3 (2025-08-07)

### ü©π Fixes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **asciidoc/loader:** remove pathe dependency and fix attribute transformation ([ee7bd0e](https://github.com/louiss0/forastro/commit/ee7bd0e))
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  migrate from esbuild to tsup Esbuild created an asciidoc build that I couldn't debug. I decided to switch to tsup! Tsup must be installed in each individual package in order to run properly. It also requires each build script is removed from the `project.json` files. I needed to make it so that each time a build is finished. The readmme's are moved to the public folders for auto publishing! ([4c03ee0](https://github.com/louiss0/forastro/commit/4c03ee0))

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Breaking Changes

- **asciidoc/loader:** None - This is a patch fix that maintains API compatibility
- For Asciidoc asciidoctorjs is external now!
