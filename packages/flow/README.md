# For Astro Flow

This package is a package that allows you to use flow components inside of [Astro](https://astro.build) Flow components are components that emulate control flow in the form of components. These components are typed well. I did this knowing that there are sometimes where you'd have to change things into an array for the to work. But other than that there should be no problems.

> [!info] There are two kinds of components in here,
> **Conditional** -> Components that show something based on a condition
> **Iterable** -> Components that iterate through a set of items then send data through a callback function

## Installation
